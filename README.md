Component = template + class(properties, methods) + Metadata

Template: Represent of fragment of user interface

Class: Code supporting the view created with TypeScript that contain the properties and methods for interact logic in the view

Metadata: Provides adcional information about angular componet these are defined as decorator

A component is a set of(Component decorator - Directive Name used in HTML - View layout)


**Interpolation**

Binding: Coordinates communication between the component's class and its template and often involves passing data.

**Directive**

Custom HTML element or attribute used to power up and extend our HTML
